JavaScript Training - Part I
============================

A brief history of JavaScript
-----------------------------
* Created by Brenden Eich in 10 days in May of 1995.
* Released as LiveScript (developed under the name Mocha) in Netscape Navigator. Changed to JS as a marketing ploy.
* Microsoft released JScript in '96, prompting Netscape to seek standardization.
* ECMA 262 Ed. 1 released in '97 as ECMAScript, followed by v2 and v3 in '98 and '99.
* ES3 is the basis of all even vaguely modern JS engines.
* DARK TIMES: '99-'09. ES4, ES4X, ES3.1, MADNESS. Eventually ES3.1 renamed to ES5, published in '09.
* Today: ES5 enjoys very [wide support](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) and we're starting to see [features of ES6](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) show up in the wild.
* Terminology summary: JavaScript is technically the name of Mozilla's implementation of ECMAScript (which has it's own [version numbers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.8)).

Nature of the beast
-------------------
* Primarily influenced by Self (prototypes), Scheme (functional), and C (imperative, syntax).
* Dynamically typed - types are associated with values, not variables.
* First-class functions - Can be passed, returned, assigned, can be nested to create closures.
* Prototype-based inheritance - JS does not have classes and never truly will.

Syntax and semantics pitfalls
-----------------------------
* Number, String, and Array
* Variable hoisting
* 'this' semantics
* Falsiness
* Numbers
* ASI
* Strict mode

Methods worth knowing
---------------------
* `call`, `apply`
* `map`, `reduce`, `forEach`
* `Object.keys`, `Object.create`
* `slice`, `splice`

Coffeescript
------------
* What it fixes
* Things to beware

Organizing your code
--------------------
* Parameter passing
* Modules
* Testability

Glimpsing the future
--------------------
* ECMAScript 6
* ECMAScript 7
* Transpiled languages
